# Distributed Agentic Cognitive Tensor Network

## 🧠 Revolutionary AI Architecture for Financial Intelligence

A groundbreaking implementation of distributed agentic cognitive tensor networks where each Cloudflare Worker acts as an "attention head" for network-wide financial cognition and transaction flow reconciliation. This system represents the first-ever deployment of cognitive financial intelligence on edge computing infrastructure.

## 🌟 **Paradigm-Shifting Innovation**

This project implements a revolutionary approach to distributed artificial intelligence by treating each edge computing node as a cognitive agent with:

- **Tensor-Based Cognition**: Each worker processes financial data through distributed tensor operations
